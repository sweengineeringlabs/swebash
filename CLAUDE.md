# Agent Instructions

## Code Quality Standards

- ALWAYS write production-ready, professional, bug-free code.
- NEVER use workarounds, hacks, or short-term fixes. Solve problems at their root.
- NEVER use simplified or placeholder implementations. Every piece of code must be complete and robust.
- Prefer correct, maintainable solutions over quick fixes — even if they take more effort.
- Treat every change as if it will ship to production immediately.
